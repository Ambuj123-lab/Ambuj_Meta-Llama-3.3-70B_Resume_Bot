    "summary": "Transitioning telecom engineer with 5+ years of FTTP & Fiber Network Experience, now focused on AI/cloud careers. Industry-certified with Google Cloud (GenAI, Vertex AI, IBM SkillsBuild) and Deloitte Data Analytics Job Simulation (Forage), where I analyzed business data, built Tableau dashboards, and classified insights in Excel. I have practical hands-on experience building & deploying live bots using IBM WatsonX and Hugging Face (self-coded, web-hosted demos). I've demonstrated expertise in Google Vertex AI by creating and managing virtual machines, configuring cloud instances, running Cloud Shell/SSH commands, and deploying ML environments. I am a fast learner, strong in AI prompt engineering, and capable of real project delivery. Open for entry-level AI, ML, cloud, or bot developer roles, ready to blend telecom domain strengths with new-gen AI/cloud skills in digital-first teams. With a background in telecom network systems and a growing expertise in generative AI and prompt engineering, I aim to bridge traditional infrastructure planning with modern AI-powered automation and design thinking. I am open to contributing in AI-driven projects, product experiments, or prompt optimization tasks where curiosity, clarity, and creative execution are valued. I also cleared BITSOM x Masai’s Product Management with Generative & Agentic AI program (2025)."
